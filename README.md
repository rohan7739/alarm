# Alarm_clock
 The "AlarmClockPro" project is a web-based application that allows users to set alarms and be notified at specific times. This project harnesses the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly alarm clock interface. 

 Technologies Used:

HTML: For creating the structure of the web page, including clock display, alarm list, and buttons.
CSS: For styling the application, creating an attractive and user-friendly interface.
JavaScript: For real-time clock functionality, handling alarm notifications, and managing user interactions.
Local Storage API: For saving and retrieving alarm settings on the user's device.
Audio: For playing alarm sounds when notifications are triggered.
